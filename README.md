# Highlights
The main highlight of this work is the successful application of Random Forest for glioma subtype classification. Through model trainiing and feature selection, we were able to identify key genes that contribute to tumor difference. The results not only demonstrate the algorithm's predictive power but also provide insight into potentially relevant biomakers.
# Overview
This project explores the use of the Random Forest algorithm to analyze glioma datasets, focusing on classifying tumor subtypes using gene expression data. The study combines biological insight with machine learning to explore how computational models can aid in medical diagnosis and research.
# Authors
This project was developed by Akash Hebbar and Chih Liu. 
# Usage Instructions
To use this project, users need to obtain a glioma gene expression dataset (such as TCGA or CGGA), and run the 'main.py' script using Python. The script handles data loading, preprocessing, model trainingm and evaluation, and will output results including accuracy and a festure importance plot.
# Installation Instructions
Before running the project, it is required to install the Python packages. After cloning the repository, dependencies can be installed by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt', which includes like 'scikit-learn', 'pandas', 'numpy', and 'matplotlib'.
